Library Management System

1 Introduction

This Laravel project assignment, "Building a Comprehensive Library Management System," is designed to demonstrate the core features of Laravel, including routing, controllers, models, form requests, views, migrations, seeders, and more. The project leverages Laravel Jetstream as the starter kit, using Livewire as the Jetstream stack within this PHP framework. The system allows users to manage books, authors, publishers, and borrowers efficiently. It supports two distinct user roles: admin user and general user, each with specific functionalities and permissions assigned to their roles.

2 Aims and objective

Some objectives of this project are:

- To perform CRUD operations in books, authors, publishers and borrowers.
- To properly implement the database relations between the tables.
- To implement search, pagination and filter facility.

3 Design

Model: In development process the component model component is responsible for managing rules/logic and data.
View: The component view is responsible to display the (UI) user interfaces to the user.
Controller: The controller component acts as a bridge between model and view.

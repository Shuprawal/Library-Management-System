### Library Management System

## Introduction

This Laravel project assignment, "Building a Comprehensive Library Management System," is designed to demonstrate the core features of Laravel, including routing, controllers, models, form requests, views, migrations, seeders, and more. The project leverages Laravel Jetstream as the starter kit, using Livewire as the Jetstream stack within this PHP framework. The system allows users to manage books, authors, publishers, and borrowers efficiently. It supports two distinct user roles: admin user and general user, each with specific functionalities and permissions assigned to their roles.

## Aims and objective

The main aim of this project is to create a library management system where user can manage books, authors, publishers and borrowers with distinct users, that are admin and a user.

Some objectives of this project are:

- To perform CRUD operations in books, authors, publishers and borrowers.
- To properly implement the database relations between the tables.
- To implement search, pagination and filter facility.

## Design
# MVC Architecture Pattern

Mode-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern that separates the development of project in main three components like: Model, View and Controller. This project follows MVC architecture pattern. 
Model: In development process the component model component is responsible for managing rules/logic and data.
View: The component view is responsible to display the (UI) user interfaces to the user.
Controller: The controller component acts as a bridge between model and view.


## Installation steps

Before setting up the project the following tools must be installed in the device:

- PHP
- Composer
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL

After installing the tools create a new project from terminal:

After creating project navigate inside that project and setup database from .env file:
![database env file](public/screenshots/env.png)

Install the npm dependencies:
![install npm](<public/screenshots/npm install.png>)
![run npm](<public/screenshots/npm dev.png>)

Start the deployment server
